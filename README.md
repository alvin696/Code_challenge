Code Challenge: Student Grade Generator and Speed Detector
This code challenge, created by Alvin Yaem, features two fun and engaging toy problems that will test your JavaScript skills. The problems are described below:

Problem 1: Student Grade Generator
Create a program that asks the user to input student marks between 0 and 100. The program should then output the corresponding grade: A for marks above 79, B for marks between 60 and 79, C for marks between 49 and 59, D for marks between 40 and 49, and E for marks less than 40.

Problem 2: Speed Detector
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car, for example, 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. For instance, if the speed is 80, it should give the driver two demerit points and print "Points: 2".
